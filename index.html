            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p><strong>UnSA</strong> (Unsplash Semantic API) is a cross-platform application developed for photography
                lovers.
                The devlopement idea behind UnSA is in using the principale of semantic web by interconnecting the
                domain photo entities such us Photo, Photogrpaher, Locations, Metadata etc </br>
                Users will be able to compare, filter and augment photos, find locations, by its own desire, also UnSA
                will suggest photos and offer 'smart' recommendations based on 'tag keywords, places (eg: current
                location)'.

                <p>
                    <strong>CQRS</strong> is a design pattern. Instead of having one unified model,
                    CQRS introduces two models: one for reads and the other one for writes.</br>
                    <b>Why CQRS?</b></br>
                    <li>
                        CQRS offers a lot of benefits, such as <b>scalability</b>. If we look to an application
                        we may notice that among create, read, updatate, delete operations, the one that is used
                        the most is usually read. There are disproportionately more reads than writes in a 
                        typical system. From this point of view it is important to scale them independently
                        from each other. For example it can hosted the command side on a single server, but create
                        a cluster of 5 servers for the queries. Because the processing of commands and queries 
                        is asymmetrical, scaling this services asymetrical makes a lot of sense too.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Performance</b> is another benefit of CQRS. It is related to scalability, but it is
                        not the same thing. Even if someone decides to host reads and writes on the same server,  
                        it is still possible to apply optimization techniques that would not be possible with a single unified model.
                        For example, just having a separate set of APIs for queries allows you to 
                        set up a cache for that specific part of the application.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Simplicity</b> is a significant benefit.
                        <b>Commands</b> are used to change data and <b>queries</b> are used to read data.
                        When you treat these two models separately, you may reduce the complexity 
                        of the application. 
                    </li>
                    UNSA application also allows us to make CRUD operations in order to visualize, augment, filter, compare photos.

                    <strong>Services</strong> are used in our application to presents different aspects regarding domain layer's entities of photography category, 
                    the relations between them, different filters and queries. Every service is associated with one or more specific use cases.

                        <p><code>Photo use cases</code> <br/>
                            There are a lot of use cases, for example we can add a photo, retrieve a photo by id,
                            or by different criteria specified by the user. One specific use case is when a user
                            wants to visualize photos from a specific category, <i>*a specified location or a specified
                             photographer. 
                            One useful  feature  could be the most downloaded or viewed photos.</i> They can be used to
                            understand people's preferences. This information could be used by interested people.
                        </p>

                            <i>*Based on user geolocation and history search, the application gives personalized photos
                            recommendations
                            (gives photos with places to visit, places which are in users area preferences eg. museums, cinema).
                            After we retrieve the personalized recommandation photos, the user may want to see
                            their localization. In this situation we have a specific use case for retrieving the 
                            locations from photos.
                            Another use case is to see the location in which the most photos were took.  
                           </i>
                        </p>

                    <li>
                        <p><code>Metadata use case</code> <br/>
                            The user is able to retrieve specific metadata about photos, for example
                            getting resolution format and aspect ratio, color palette in RGB format, 
                            camera model and camera brand.
                            Metadata will be used in other processes like filtering and comparing photo.
                        </p>

                            <i>*A very common use case is to retrieve information about most famous photographers.
                            The user is also able to retrieve information for a specific photographer even
                            if this is not famous, or to retrieve all photographers and information about them.
                            Another use case is to get locations photographed by a specific photographer.

                Each service interogates SPARQL endpoint to find information about entities and relationships between them and also to store data
                into UNSA's RDF storage implemented with GraphDB.

                    <strong>Authentication</strong> relies on the JSON Web Token (JWT). Each call to the application exposed by UNSA API
                    requires a specific token and the access is allowed only if it is valid and it is not expired.

                The application design offers a pleasant experience, because its interface is very intuitive.
                Also the UI is modern and relies on latest features of Ionic5.

                            based on his preferences from search bar and additional combobox.
                            The user is able to visualise and download them.

                        <p><strong>Tags View</strong> offers the possibility to augment different photos selected by 
                            the user. An augmentation is equivalent with adding a metadata to the photo. 
                            The metadata is obtained after recognition step for each photo from selected photo list.

                            The UNSA application requires the users to be authorized. 
                            The user must register and sing in into the app. After log in is succesfull
                            a JWT token is generated. Every subsequent call of the UNSA API will require that token.

                            The data transfer between client and backend is done through HTTP/HTTPs protocol
                            and they are packed into json.

                           There are a separation between queries and commands, this is done by CQRS pattern.
                           Every HTTP/HTTPs request will be managed either by a command or query usecase.
                           In every scenario of the usecases the access to SPARQL endpoint will rely on repositories.
                           The SPARQL endpoint expose the GraphDB data to make the user able to modify them.

                    <p>
                        Unsa is an application which is destinated to photography lovers.
                        The proposed document is associated with a prototype application 
                        that currently offers the following functionalities:
                        Users are able to visualize photos, to compare , augment and
                        filter them. 
                        The recommandation part is still in work.
                        In addition to the client application,
                        UNSA also expose an api that users can access in order to use it in other applications. 
                        <p>In case of <strong>migration</strong> of the proposed solution: API and client application,
                        for the population of the data graph (triple store) it will be necessary 
                        a long time because despite the fact that the code is asynchronous, 
                        when inserting new data it is necessary to synchronize the insertion operations of 
                        new triples (eg: a metadata associated with a photo has a color,
                        so it is necessary to insert the color entity after which the metadata instance 
                        will be linked) in order to keep the data consistent.
